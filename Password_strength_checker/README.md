# Password Strength Checker - Brainwave Matrix Internship Project

## Overview
This is a simple Password Strength Checker tool developed during my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions.  
The unique feature of this project is that it rates the strength of a password by comparing it with fictional characters, making password security fun and relatable.

## Features
- Checks password strength based on length, complexity, and common password list
- Matches password strength with a fictional character for intuitive understanding
- Simple terminal-based interaction

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the script:
4. Enter a password when prompted to see its strength and matched fictional character.

## Project Structure
- `app.py` — Main Python script for checking password strength
- `common_passwords.txt` — List of 10,000 commonly used passwords used for comparison
- `README.md` — Documentation file

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Basic file handling and conditional logic
---

## Future Improvements
- Add GUI for better user experience
- Use entropy-based strength checking
- Provide suggestions for weak passwords
